# Analyze a dataset "SalesOfMedicalDevices"

The aim of this project is to analyze a dataset provided by a business owner called "SalesOfMedicalDevices".
I did this project using Jupyter Notebook and Python code. The code includes many data mining techniques that helped me perform this analysis. The dataset includes several variables such as CustomerID, year, NoOfSalesCalls, NoOfTargetedEmails, NoOfSales, and customer satisfaction levels. Using data mining techniques, I will investigate the relationships and similarities between the variables to help the owner better understand the data and gain insights that can potentially improve his business strategies.
