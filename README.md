# Analyze a dataset "SalesOfMedicalDevices"

The objective of this project is to analyze the "SalesOfMedicalDevices" dataset provided by a business owner. To achieve this, I utilized Jupyter Notebook and Python code, implementing various data mining techniques to explore the dataset's variables such as CustomerID, year, NoOfSalesCalls, NoOfTargetedEmails, NoOfSales, and customer satisfaction levels. Through this analysis, I aimed to identify the relationships and similarities between these variables and provide insights to the owner that could help improve his business strategies.
