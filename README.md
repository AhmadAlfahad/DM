# Analyze a dataset "SalesOfMedicalDevices"
I did this project using Jupyter Notebook and Python code. The code includes many data mining techniques that helped me perform this analysis.

The aim of this project is to analyze a dataset provided by a business owner called "SalesOfMedicalDevices". The dataset includes several variables such as CustomerID, year, NoOfSalesCalls, NoOfTargetedEmails, NoOfSales, and customer satisfaction levels. Using data mining techniques, I will investigate the relationships and similarities between the variables to help the owner better understand the data and gain insights that can potentially improve his business strategies.
